"Machine Learning model to predict housing prices in Gurgaon with 94% R² accuracy." 

# Gurgaon Housing Price Prediction 🏠📊

This project focuses on predicting housing prices in Gurgaon using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various features of houses and apartments, such as location, area, number of bedrooms, amenities, and other relevant factors. The main goal is to build a predictive model that can help buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions.

# *Key Features*:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data for better model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and insights to understand trends and correlations in the housing market.

Modeling: Implemented multiple regression-based machine learning models to predict housing prices accurately.

Evaluation: Model performance is measured using MAE (15766.50) and RMSE (27811.56) to assess prediction accuracy.

Python Libraries Used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

# *Potential Use Cases*:

Estimate property prices for buying or selling.

Provide insights into the real estate market in Gurgaon.

Serve as a foundation for more advanced housing price prediction models.

This repository is ideal for beginners and intermediate learners in machine learning, data preprocessing, and regression modeling, providing a hands-on example of a real-world problem.
